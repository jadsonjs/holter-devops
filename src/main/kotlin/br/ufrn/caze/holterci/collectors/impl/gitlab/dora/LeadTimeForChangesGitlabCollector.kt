/**
 * Lead time for changes is the amount of time it takes a code change to get into production.
 *
 * In GitLab, Lead time for changes is measure by the Median time it takes for a merge request to get merged into production (from master).
 *
 * GitLab calculates Lead time for changes base on the number of seconds to successfully deliver a commit into production - from code committed
 * to code successfully running in production, without adding the coding_time to the calculation.
 *
 * We will calcuted as the time the commit was created until it be merge in the production branch.
 *
 * Lead Time For Changes  =  Mean of ALL ( mergeRequest_in_prodution_branch.merged_at - commit.created_at  )
